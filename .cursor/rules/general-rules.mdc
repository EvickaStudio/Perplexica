alwaysApply: true

- **Read Project Documentation First**: Before generating any code, carefully read the project's documentation and conventions:
    - [project-conventions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc) to understand how to write code for the codebase.
    - [project-architecture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-architecture.mdc) to understand the system architecture and data flow.
    - [ui-ux-design-guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ui-ux-design-guidelines.mdc) to understand how to implement frontend code.

- **Follow Existing Patterns**: Always follow the existing coding patterns and conventions found in the project. If a file has a certain style, maintain that style.

- **Verify with `package.json`**: Before using a new library or framework, check `package.json` to see if it's already a dependency. Do not add new dependencies without a strong reason.

- **Run Verification Scripts**: After making changes, run the following scripts to ensure code quality:
    - `npm run lint`
    - `npm run format:write`

## Prohibited Actions

- Do not run `npm start` or `npm run dev` in your responses.
- Do not modify the `README.md` or `LICENSE` files unless explicitly asked to.
